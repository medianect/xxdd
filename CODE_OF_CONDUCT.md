# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
project a harassment-free experience.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open and healthy
project.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints.
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
discussed with the project leaders responsible for enforcement at
`open+discussion|at|medianect.com`. All messages will be reviewed.

All past, present, future project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy
and security of these discussions.
